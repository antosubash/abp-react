## üîß Code Contributions

### Code Style Guidelines

We follow these coding standards:

#### TypeScript

```typescript
// Use explicit types
interface UserProps {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Use function declarations for components
export const UserProfile: React.FC<UserProps> = ({ id, name, email }) => {
  return <div>{name}</div>;
};

// Use async/await for promises
const fetchUser = async (id: string): Promise<User> => {
  const response = await UserService.getUser({ id });
  return response.data;
};
```

#### React Components

```typescript
// Use functional components with hooks
const UserList: React.FC = () => {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState<User[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    loadUsers();
  }, []);

  const loadUsers = async () => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      const data = await UserService.getUsers();
      setUsers(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load users:', error);
    } finally {
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      {users.map(user => (
        <UserCard key={user.id} user={user} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### CSS and Styling

```css
/* Use Tailwind CSS classes */
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4 p-6 bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900">User Profile</h2>
  <p className="text-gray-600">User information and settings</p>
</div>

/* Custom CSS should be minimal and follow BEM methodology */
.user-profile {
  /* Component styles */
}

.user-profile__header {
  /* Element styles */
}

.user-profile--compact {
  /* Modifier styles */
}
```

### Testing Guidelines

Write comprehensive tests for your code:

```typescript
// Component tests
describe('UserProfile', () => {
  it('renders user information correctly', () => {
    const user = { id: '1', name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' };
    render(<UserProfile user={user} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(screen.getByText('john@example.com')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});

// Hook tests
describe('useUser', () => {
  it('fetches user data successfully', async () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useUser('1'));
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(result.current.data).toBeDefined();
    });
  });
});
```
