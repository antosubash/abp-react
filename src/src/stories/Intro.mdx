- **Content blocks and sections** - Reusable content components
- **Layout and grid components** - Flexible layout system
- **Media and interactive elements** - Images, videos, and interactive content
- **Customizable styling options** - Theme-aware styling system

### ðŸ§ª Testing Features
Comprehensive testing tools to ensure your components work perfectly across all scenarios.

- **Visual regression testing** - Automated visual testing with Chromatic
- **Accessibility validation** - Built-in a11y testing
- **Interactive component testing** - Use Vitest for component testing
- **Performance monitoring** - Track component performance

### ðŸ“š Documentation
Detailed documentation and examples for every component, making development faster and more reliable.

- **Component API documentation** - Complete prop documentation
- **Usage examples and patterns** - Real-world usage scenarios
- **Best practices and guidelines** - Development standards
- **Accessibility considerations** - WCAG compliance guidelines

## How to Use

### 1. Browse Components
Navigate through the sidebar to find the component you need. Each component has multiple stories showing different use cases.

### 2. Test Interactions
Use the Controls panel to modify component props and see changes in real-time. This helps you understand how each prop affects the component's appearance and behavior.

### 3. Check Accessibility
Use the Accessibility addon to ensure your components meet WCAG standards. The addon will highlight potential accessibility issues and provide recommendations.

### 4. Test Responsiveness
Use the Viewport addon to test how components look and behave on different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

### 5. Run Tests
Use the Testing addon to run interactive tests on your components, ensuring they work correctly across different scenarios.

## Contributing

When adding new components:

1. **Create the component** in the appropriate directory
2. **Add comprehensive stories** showing different use cases
3. **Include accessibility considerations** in your design
4. **Test across different viewports** to ensure responsiveness
5. **Update this documentation** if needed

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Components

1. Create your component in the appropriate directory
2. Add TypeScript interfaces for props
3. Create comprehensive stories with different states
4. Add accessibility attributes and ARIA labels
5. Test across different viewports and themes
6. Document any special usage patterns

### Story Guidelines

- **Primary story**: Shows the component in its most common use case
- **Variants**: Show different prop combinations and states
- **Edge cases**: Demonstrate error states, loading states, etc.
- **Accessibility**: Include stories that test keyboard navigation and screen readers
